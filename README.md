## Let's get Started!

First the minimum required pre reqs..

figure out what a "cloud shell" is
https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-shell

## Actually.. First here I want..

### how a cloud shell do?
is a vm in googles servers. it's basically the same thing as 
microsoft's vscode or vscodium...
(it is really seems to be running this other 
code-server adaptation in a docker container)

it's basically better than a local solution with a ups
cause it'll always be saved, duh.

you get 5GB of persistent home space 
the upshot is that so long as you always be coding
and don't not code for 30 days your little linux computer in 
the all powerfull cloud will persist because it'll just boot up 
and attatch your home drive allotment.

I beleive because google believes in free education if you 
have code that later uses their api we can get you a 
second "persistent" thought compute engine VM micro instance..
to control the lights.

For now that's a better than a lorem epsiom right?

Anyway Assuming you've found this you have at least a gmail

so click THIS!

or not whatever... 
    I'll try to make it more worth it later.
