## Let's get Started!

First lets go find two ways to set 
global user and gloabl email in the git config
this is saved in the file ~/.gitconfig

```bash
git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
```

```bash
git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"
```
### Recomendation

Set this to your github handle and registered address.

### open the file and check that it's correct

```bash
cat ~/.gitconfig
```
